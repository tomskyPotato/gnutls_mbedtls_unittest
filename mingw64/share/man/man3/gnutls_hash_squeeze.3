.SH NAME
gnutls_hash_squeeze \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/crypto.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_hash_squeeze(gnutls_hash_hd_t " handle ", void * " output ", size_t " length ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_hash_hd_t handle" 12
a \fBgnutls_hash_hd_t\fP
.IP "void * output" 12
destination to store the output; must be equal to or larger than  \fIlength\fP 
.IP "size_t length" 12
length of  \fIoutput\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract digest output of  \fIlength\fP bytes. The  \fIhandle\fP must
be initialized with \fBgnutls_hash_init()\fP as an extended output function (XOF),
such as \fBGNUTLS_DIG_SHAKE_128\fP or \fBGNUTLS_DIG_SHAKE_256\fP.

This function can be called multiple times. To reset the state of  \fIhandle\fP ,
call \fBgnutls_hash_deinit()\fP with \fBNULL\fP as the digest argument.
